# Roadmap — StashJar

## Now (stabilize + ship)
- Miniapp packaging finalization (host integration checklist, deeplinks, and test matrix)
- Observability dashboards (request timing, auth, funding, push)
- Error taxonomy + consistent client UX for rate limits and daily limits

## Next (retention + value)
- Weekly recap email polish (templates, segmenting, unsubscribe handling)
- Streak recovery/shield (POWER): allow recovery rules that are challenge-aware
- Challenge library expansion:
  - Monthly rollups
  - “Payday Friday” cadence
  - Percent-of-income variants

## Later (growth)
- Multi-device session manager
- Referral rewards (gated by actions)
- Multiple jars / goals
- Multi-asset staking (POWER) if needed (still normie-surface stays USDC)

## Never (unless we pivot)
- Becoming a regulated custodial bank
- Non-compliant “auto-money” behaviors
